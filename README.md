Government spyware? join the hunt for slacker coders

Is this part of the legendary 'all time code fail' of the FBI case file management system? or is it some lesser spyware? Come join the fun in REVERSE-ENGINEERING this bit of Windows code, and see what your government has been up to. I mean, just exactly how are they wasting your money.

   Just read the first few paragraphs of the log file, and you'll see right away why it has generated so much suspicion over the years. Of course, the main concern is why is there a file inside my computer OS that repeatedly references the FBI and the CIA, in numerous instances, in the same file, as well as seeming to reference obscure, if not unknown engineering tweaks and standards (like IEEE) CIA 2? Wait, this came from the year 2001, and the world was already at level CIA 2, does that mean CIA 1 came about much earlier, as in maybe the 1980's. So US Intel agencies were doing world spying using Windows 3.1 maybe? Really, I'm LMFAO folks, I couldn't even get my Tandy 100 to boot, much less spy! No wonder the terrorists are winning, we're being led by a bunch of idiots.
   
   So you can view the file here in the main branch, and feel free to add your 2 cents via comments, etc., or you can view the whole file (in a separate browser maybe) at pastebin.com/u/agentpgp. The backboard line number grid at pastebin is very helpful, and you'll see this file runs over 2000 lines long, but most is recursive or repeating. I'll post the main questions that need to be answered regarding this file, and share some of my admittedly amateur insights as well.
   
   GO AHEAD, HAVE A DRINK, THIS IS MEANT TO BE FUN!
